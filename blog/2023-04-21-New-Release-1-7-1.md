# New Version `1.7.1.` available.

Today we have release our new version with the following changes:

- Modifications:
    - `NopeRpcManager`: 
      - listens on `bonjour`-messages
      - :::danger Braking Change:

        RPC - Manager: `registerService` is now async! (see `INopeInstanceManager` as well)

        :::
    - `NopeInstanceManager`:    
      - listens on `bonjour`-messages
    - `getDispatcher`:
      - The method uses a logger now. It will render the errors.
- Fixes:
    - `NopeInstanceManager`:
      - fixing `instanceExists`      
      - `registerInstance` now emits the instances
    - `PubSubSystemBase`:
      - fixed the internal matching structure
      - fixed `updateMatching`
      - fided `_notify`: The `dataQuery` only considers the events that have been published during notification!
    - `templates`:
      - Fixing Typescript-Templates (still had some old 'nope' references)
    - fixed tpyos in `00-start.md`
- New Features:
    - `NopeInstanceManager` and `INopeInstanceManager`:
      - Added method `generateWrapper`. That allows to create Wrappers for **static** added instances (via. `registerInstance`)
    - `helpers.comparePatternAndPath`: 
      - Fixing issues during path comparing!
    - **Tutorials** (juypter-notebooks) for 
      - dataDistributor
      - rpcManager
      - InstanceManagers
      - Plugins
      - eventDistributor
